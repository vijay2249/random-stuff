## ___About___
A simple python script to zip required folder.

Stores the snapshot of your work folder based on number of times you run this program

This creates a new Zip file with the same name and the snapshot number of the work folder

This is like creating git commits except that each time you create a new zip folder with the changes you made

Takes the folder path as the input and does the job for youðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„

-se             | boolean value (__*default value is True*__), this is to display files that caused error in zipping these files, these files are showed after the completion
-me             | boolean value (__*by default it copies the files to the error directory*__), this is to **move** the files to the error folder if these files are creating error while zipping them
